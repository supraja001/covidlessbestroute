For implementing the proposed system Google Collaboratory platform is used as
an interface.
Steps involved:
1.Web Scraping
2.Map Generation using folium
3. Application of Dijkstra algorithm
4.Route Generation
From the Dijkstra algorithm, output is obtained in the form of a list. Again, the list
is shown visually on the map generated. The route is highlighted with any specific
color.
